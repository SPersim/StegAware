She puts all the items in her cart, goes to the checkout page, fills out her information, and does the purchase. She notices some links to social media where to share her purchase, which she does. A week later she suddenly notices some unknown purchases made using her bank information. She had fallen victim to an attack where steganography was used to hide skimming malware inside the social media logos. The image on the website containing the malicious software is also called the '_____ _____'.",

According to Kerckhoffs's principle, it is assumed that an adversary will know everything about the design of the steganographic system. To adhere to this principle, steganography is almost always supplemented with cryptography; also called _____ steganography.",

      "category": "fill-in",
      "explanation": "A secret key in steganography is used to encrypt the message, as well as determine where in the image the secret data is hidden. Using such a key would make it impossible for an interceptor to decipher the hidden message. Without this encryption the message would be easily deciphered from the cover image. For this reason, steganography should be viewed as a supplement to cryptography rather than a replacement.",

So A is 00001, B is 00010, and finally Z is 11010. Paul tries decoding the message by looking at the Least Significant Bit of each byte.

      "explanation": "The color of each pixel is represented by an RGB value. This consists of 3 bytes of data for each value of Red, Blue, and Green. By applying the LSB method to hide date we change the last bit of data of each byte and therefore slightly changing the color of the resulting image. Putting all the last bits in order from left to right we get 01001 01100 11001 which according to the table translates to 'ILY'; or in non-abbreviated form 'I Love You'.",

The slave was then sent to Aristagoras, who'd been told to shave the slave's head and read the message telling him to rise up against the Persians. This marked the beginning of the Ionian revolt, which served as a prelude to the Greco-Persian wars and the Persians' ongoing conflict with the Greeks.
